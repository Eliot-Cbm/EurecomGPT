# Phase 2 — Reflection: where does parallelism stop helping?

Copy this file to `submission/phase2_reflection.md`, fill in every answer slot, and commit it:

```bash
cp phase-2-tiny-gpt/reflection_template.md submission/phase2_reflection.md
```

**How to fill it in.** Each answer sits between a pair of `<!--answer:...-->` markers. Replace
the `TODO` line with your answer — **leave the markers themselves untouched**, they are how the
grader finds your answers. Anything you write outside the markers is ignored, so add extra
prose, tables or your threading plot freely.

Numbers in section 1 must **match `submission/phase2_report.json`** — copy them across, do not
retype from memory; they are checked against it.

## 1. Your measurements

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Naive attention, ms (`attention.naive_ms`) | <!--answer:attn_naive_ms-->TODO<!--/answer--> |
| Vectorized attention, ms (`attention.vectorized_ms`) | <!--answer:attn_vectorized_ms-->TODO<!--/answer--> |
| CPU training, ms for 100 steps (`devices.cpu_ms`) | <!--answer:cpu_ms-->TODO<!--/answer--> |
| GPU training, ms for 100 steps (`devices.gpu_ms`) | <!--answer:gpu_ms-->TODO<!--/answer--> |
| Final training loss (`training.final_loss`) | <!--answer:final_loss-->TODO<!--/answer--> |

**The thread sweep.** Give your four timings from `threads` — 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads — and say
which count was fastest. (verbatim: the numbers, in order)

## 2. Intra-node parallelism, three ways

**Why vectorizing wins.** Both attention implementations do the same arithmetic and produce the
same result (the unit test checks that). Explain where the naive version's time actually goes,
and what the vectorized one does differently — in terms of the machine, not the Python.

**Where the thread curve flattens, and why.** Using your sweep: more threads stopped helping —
or started hurting — at some point. Say where, and give the reason. Your Colab runtime's vCPU
count is part of the answer; so is what the threads have to coordinate on. (~80 words)

<!--/answer-->

**What made the GPU faster.** The model, the data and the step count were identical; only the
device changed. Say what about a transformer training step suits a GPU, and name one workload
that would *not* see this speed-up. (~70 words)

## 3. The question

**Where does parallelism stop helping, and why?** Pull the three experiments together. Your
answer should distinguish the *kinds* of limit you met — work that cannot be divided, hardware
you do not have, coordination that costs more than it saves, data that has to move — and say
which one bound each experiment. One concrete number from section 1 per claim. (~150 words)

<!--/answer-->

**What you would measure next.** One experiment this phase did not run that would sharpen the
answer, and what result would change your mind. (~50 words)
